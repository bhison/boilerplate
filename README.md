# Bhison Boilerplate
To work you will need to...

- Install NPM/Node (type this on google!)
- At command line in this folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Install nodemon globally with `npm install nodemon -g`

When you want to use it...

- Copy the content you want to access in to the `/dist` folder, removing anything already in there
- Navigate to this boilerplate's folder at command line
- Run `npm start`
- Go on your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 
- To stop, on command line hit `Ctrl + c` to end the process
- **Note:** it is set up to reload your page every time something in your directory changes, however this fails...regularly. If something isn't working how you'd expect, stop and start your project
